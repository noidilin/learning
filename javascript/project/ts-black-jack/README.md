# TypeScript Blackjack Game

A console-based blackjack game implementing object-oriented programming principles with TypeScript.

## Key Learning Points

- **Classes and Interfaces**: Implementation of classes (`Card`, `Deck`) with interface contracts (`ICard`, `IDealable`)
- **Enums**: Using enums for card suits with unicode symbols
- **Generic Functions**: Generic array shuffling utility function
- **Method Implementation**: Interface method implementation in classes
- **Static Class Members**: Static readonly properties for card value mappings
- **Game Logic**: Complex game state management and turn-based logic
- **Input Validation**: User input validation and error handling
- **Private/Public Access Modifiers**: Proper encapsulation with private methods

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript 5.3.3
- prompt-sync for console input
- Node.js runtime environment

## Features

- Complete blackjack game logic with betting system
- Player and dealer turns with proper game rules
- Card deck management with shuffling
- Balance tracking and game continuation
- Input validation for bets and decisions

## TypeScript Concepts Demonstrated

- Interface implementation
- Class inheritance and composition
- Enum usage with string values
- Generic type constraints
- Access modifiers (private, public)
- Static class members
- Non-null assertion operator
- Type guards and validation
