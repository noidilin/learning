# TypeScript React - Todo Application

A React-based todo application demonstrating TypeScript integration with modern React patterns.

## Key Learning Points

- **React Component Typing**: Proper typing of React components with Props interfaces
- **State Management**: Type-safe useState hooks with generic type parameters
- **Event Handling**: Typing React event handlers and form events
- **Component Props**: Defining and using typed component props
- **Hook Integration**: TypeScript with useEffect and useState hooks
- **Local Storage with React**: Persistent state management in React applications
- **Component Composition**: Breaking down UI into reusable typed components

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript 5.2.2
- React 18.2.0
- Vite (build tool)
- ESLint with TypeScript support

## Features

- Add and toggle todo tasks
- Persistent storage using localStorage
- Component-based architecture
- Type-safe prop passing between components
- Form validation and submission handling

## TypeScript + React Concepts Demonstrated

- React.FC vs function component typing
- Props interface definitions
- Event handler typing (React.FormEvent)
- Generic hooks (useState<Task[]>)
- Component composition patterns
- Type imports vs value imports
- Functional updates with state setters
