# My Learning Journey

> This is an initial draft by ChatGPT.

Welcome to my coding portfolio! This repository showcases my learning journey through various small projects leading up to two final projects where I combine **React** with **GSAP** and **three.js** to create interactive, visually compelling web experiences. Each project reflects the concepts and technologies Iâ€™ve learned along the way.

> [!caution] redundant node_modules folders
> Clean `node_modules` folder after finished each project can prune this repo to a manageable size.
> Since 'explore.exe' and 'pwsh' have bad reputation about removing `node_modules` folder, it is recommended to use npm package `rimraf` to remove `node_modules`.
> In the directory that contains `node_modules`, execute command `rimraf node_modules`.

## Final Projects

1. **Interactive Animation with React & GSAP**  
   This project will focus on combining **React** with **GSAP** (GreenSock Animation Platform) to create smooth, high-performance animations. It demonstrates my ability to build dynamic interfaces with complex animation sequences.

2. **3D Web Experience with React & three.js**  
   In this project, Iâ€™ll use **React** alongside **three.js** to create a 3D interactive web environment. This project will highlight my skills in integrating 3D models into a web interface while ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Small Learning Projects

Each of these smaller projects represents a key step in my learning process. They allowed me to build up my skills and experiment with concepts that are critical to my final projects.

1. **HTML & CSS Responsive Design**
   Get into the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. Primarily focus on modern layout techniques such as Flexbox and CSS Grid.

- **[project: omnifood](./project-css-omnifood/)**

2. **SASS**  
   A basic to-do list application to practice JavaScript DOM manipulation and state management. Itâ€™s a precursor to more complex projects with React.

- **[project: nexter](./project-css-sass-nexter/)**
- **[project: trillo](./project-css-sass-trillo/)**
- **[project: natours](./project-css-sass-natours/)**
- **[project: pixel-rocket](./project-css-sass-pixel-rocket/)**

3. **React State Management & Props**  
   A simple React app where I explored component hierarchy, props, and state management. This project helped solidify my understanding of how React handles data flow.

4. **React with API Integration**  
   This project fetches data from an API and renders it dynamically in a React component. It demonstrates my ability to work with asynchronous data fetching and API integration.

5. **GSAP Animation Basics**  
   A small project focused on learning the core features of **GSAP** for creating animations. This will serve as the foundation for my final project with React and GSAP.

6. **3D Scene with three.js**  
   A basic three.js setup to experiment with rendering 3D models in the browser. This project explores camera angles, lighting, and object manipulation, setting the stage for my three.js final project.
