# My Learning Journey

> This is an initial draft by ChatGPT.

Welcome to my coding portfolio! This repository showcases my learning journey through various small projects leading up to two final projects where I combine **React** with **GSAP** and **three.js** to create interactive, visually compelling web experiences. Each project reflects the concepts and technologies Iâ€™ve learned along the way.

## Final Projects

1. **Interactive Animation with React & GSAP**  
   This project will focus on combining **React** with **GSAP** (GreenSock Animation Platform) to create smooth, high-performance animations. It demonstrates my ability to build dynamic interfaces with complex animation sequences.

2. **3D Web Experience with React & three.js**  
   In this project, Iâ€™ll use **React** alongside **three.js** to create a 3D interactive web environment. This project will highlight my skills in integrating 3D models into a web interface while ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Small Learning Projects

Each of these smaller projects represents a key step in my learning process. They allowed me to build up my skills and experiment with concepts that are critical to my final projects.

1. **HTML & CSS Responsive Design**  
   A simple responsive webpage to practice the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. This project focuses on modern layout techniques such as Flexbox and CSS Grid.

2. **JavaScript To-Do App**  
   A basic to-do list application to practice JavaScript DOM manipulation and state management. Itâ€™s a precursor to more complex projects with React.

3. **React State Management & Props**  
   A simple React app where I explored component hierarchy, props, and state management. This project helped solidify my understanding of how React handles data flow.

4. **React with API Integration**  
   This project fetches data from an API and renders it dynamically in a React component. It demonstrates my ability to work with asynchronous data fetching and API integration.

6. **3D Scene with three.js**  
   A basic three.js setup to experiment with rendering 3D models in the browser. This project explores camera angles, lighting, and object manipulation, setting the stage for my three.js final project.
